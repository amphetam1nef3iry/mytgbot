### What is mybot

mybot is a telegram bot for getting to know other HSE students.

### How do I set it up?

* First, you need to create a file named ".token" and add the Telegram bot token to it so that mybot can get the environment variable named "TOKEN".
* Then, you need to download aiogram
* Lastly, you need to source ".token"(so that the variable loads into the environment) and run "bot.py"
